        <h2>Rule the Realm</h2>
        <p>
          Rule the Realm is a turn based strategy game in which players
          raise earn gold to raise armies and conquer the map! Players
          begin with 2 gold and earn 1 gold per turn plus an additional
          gold for every 5 tiles they own. They can use this gold to
          purchase units. As units explore the map they encounter enemies.
          When enemies are encountered the game goes into battle mode
          where units are deployed onto a new hex grid against enemy units.
          Units that survive the battle and participated in killing
          enemies are able to level up and increase either their attack
          or defense. However, even high level units are vulnerable
          because attack and defense scores represent a range between 0
          and that score which means that a new unit always has a chance
          to kill a high powered unit. Units will also encounter other
          races. If a player captures the base of another race they can
          use it to recruit troops of that race. Rule the Realm is a game
          of luck and strategy! Will you be able to raise an army and
          conquer the realm?
